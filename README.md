# Lean Tutorial

This repo is my attempt to teach myself the basics of the lean
programming language and proof assistant.  My basic approach is go
through each section
of [Theorem Proving in Lean](theorem_proving_in_lean.pdf). Work
through all examples and write posts about my experience. Hopefully,
the additional posts will be of benefit to others.

## Progress

1. [ ] Introduction
2. [ ] Dependent Type Theory
3. [ ] Propositions and Proofs
4. [ ] Quantifiers and Equality
5. [ ] Tactics
6. [ ] Interacting with Lean
7. [ ] Inductive Types
8. [ ] Induction and Recursion
9. [ ] Structures and Records
10. [ ] Type Classes
11. [ ] Axioms and Computation
